# BQC
This project leverages quantum annealing and reinforcement learning to create a sophisticated trading bot for the stock market. The bot uses historical stock data to train a model that makes trading decisions based on support and resistance levels, moving averages, RSI, and stop-loss thresholds.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.6 or later
Necessary Python libraries:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
dwave-ocean-sdk
dimod
alpaca-trade-api
You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib dwave-ocean-sdk dimod alpaca-trade-api
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-finance-trading-bot.git
cd quantum-finance-trading-bot
Place your historical stock data CSV file (Historic_data_SPY.csv) in the data/ directory.

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Training the Model
Run the training script to train the model:

bash
Copy code
python BQC.py
The training script will:

Load historical stock data.
Calculate support and resistance levels, moving averages, and RSI.
Train the trading model using a quantum annealer and Q-learning.
Save the trained model to a file (model_episode_100.pkl).
Paper Trading with Alpaca
Ensure you have an Alpaca account and have obtained your API key and secret key. Replace 'your_api_key' and 'your_secret_key' in the paper_trading.py script with your actual Alpaca API credentials.

Run the paper trading script:

bash
Copy code
python paper_trading.py
The paper trading script will:

Load the trained model.
Fetch live market data from the Alpaca API.
Make trading decisions and execute trades based on the model's predictions.
Iterate this process for 30 days to simulate trading.
